** 5. Structural Dynamics
   - Ported the lab using automation script.
   - Experiments and feedback should port manually in Iframe.
   - After porting the lab using automation script included the
     following sections that are missed out during porting:
     Introduction, Objective and  Experiment
   - While porting the lab introduction sections, the content for all
     the sub-sections of Introduction section is not exported. Added
     the content for all such sub sections.
   - In objective section of every experiment images were
     missed. Added images. 
   - In all the experiment sections the content is ported using text
     editor of HTML component.
   - Removed all the experiment sections and added again using iframe
     tool.
   - Testing of the lab is finished except experiments. Have to test
     the experiments which needs java plugins to run the experiments.

   - Total No of issues raised : 87

** Open-edx Issues 
   1) Issues in the experiment section:
      -  In the experiment section, experiment is not visible in small
         screen, whereas it is visible in full screen .
   2) Issues in the Assessment scetion:
      - Show Answer button is visible when we login as admin. If we
        login as user, "Show Answer" button is not visble and unable
        to include the button.
      - In the  Image processing lab,  assignment is not  available in
        small screen, whereas it is visible in the full screen.
   3) BeadCrumb is exceeding and overlapping the "Bookmark" button.
   4) Lab ID and name on the grey screen is displaying correctly when
      the screen is morethen 100%.
   5) If there are special charcters in the quiz questions, unable to port 
      the quiz section. So, removed such questions and ported the quiz section.
